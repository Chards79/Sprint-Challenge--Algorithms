#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)
This is a linear equation the way that it is set up. The loop will continue to evaluate the number of times that n equals. So whatever n equals comes out to be the number of times that the loop is run. The bigger n is the more times the loop will run.

b) O(log n)
This code is not quite linear. The bigger the input you enter, the more it continues to grow but not at the same rate as the numbers that you are entering.

c) O(1)
This is a constant equation. No matter what you put in, you will just get one thing out. If this were set up in some kind of loop it would probably be linear, because with each increasing number of input your output also increases by one, but there is no loop and so it just gives one constant output.
