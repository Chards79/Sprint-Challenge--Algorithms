#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)
This is a linear equation the way that it is set up. The loop will continue to evaluate the number of times that n equals. So whatever n equals comes out to be the number of times that the loop is run. The bigger n is the more times the loop will run.

b) O(n log n)
This code is not quite linear. The bigger the input you enter, the more it continues to grow but not at the same rate as the numbers that you are entering. But it is also adding to the sum with each iteration which is where the n part of n log n comes from.

c) O(n)
This is another linear equation because as n (or bunnies) increases so does the output, and it increases at a constant rate.
